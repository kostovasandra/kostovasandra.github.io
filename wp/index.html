<h3>Project 1</h3>
Create a web presentation (web site) about yourself. Focus on both your professional interests as well as <br> your personal interests.
The main aim of this project is to use Git + GitHub Pages Jekyll + Markdown <br> technologies. 
My first project is available on this <ins><a href="http://kostovasandra.github.io/">link</a></ins>.
<h3>Project 2</h3>
The subject of the second project is to make a transformation to a selected document (ideal bachelor <br>project) from its original format to DocBook format. The final version needs to be generated in PDF format. <br>
For successful solution I have used a predefined template on which I needed to do changes.<br> The main goal was to create a format that is similar with the format of my bachelor thesis. In the main xml document I used elements like: &lt;chapter&gt;, &lt;section&gt;, &lt;bibliography&gt; to define the structure. <br>Within these elements another were also defined. For example &lt;para&gt;, &lt;literallayout&gt;, &lt;figure&gt;, &lt;table&gt;.  In the <br>thesis.xsl file some changes were made because a lists of used tables and images were required.<br> For inserting a Java code in the documents I used the element &lt;programlisting&gt;, and &lt;emhpasis&gt;, &lt;orderlist&gt;  etc. were useful for better stylization of the text. The elements link and xref were used for making <br>references to the part of the text/to the bibliography. Usage of attributes can be also noticed: role, id, url, language etc.
