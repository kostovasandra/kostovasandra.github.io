The main focus of this subject are XML and related technologies. <br>Subject introduces students to the basics of computer typesetting <br> and typography recoverable even for traditional paper  publishing.

<h3>Project 1</h3>
Create a web presentation (web site) about yourself. Focus on both your professional interests as well as <br> your personal interests.
The main aim of this project is to use Git + GitHub Pages Jekyll + Markdown <br> technologies. 
My first project is available on this <ins><a href="http://kostovasandra.github.io/">link</a></ins>.
<h3>Project 2</h3>
The subject of the second project is to make a transformation to a selected document (ideal bachelor <br>project) from its original format to DocBook format. The final version needs to be generated in PDF format. <br>
For successful solution I have used a predefined template on which I needed to do changes.<br> The main goal was to create a format that is similar with the format of my bachelor thesis. In the main xml<br> document I used elements like: &lt;chapter&gt;, &lt;section&gt;, &lt;bibliography&gt; to define the structure. <br>Within these elements another were also defined. For example &lt;para&gt;, &lt;literallayout&gt;, &lt;figure&gt;, &lt;table&gt;.  In the <br>thesis.xsl file some changes were made because a lists of used tables and images were required.<br> For inserting a Java code in the documents I used the element &lt;programlisting&gt;, and &lt;emhpasis&gt;, &lt;orderlist&gt;  etc.<br> were useful for better stylization of the text. The elements &lt;link&gt; and &lt;xref&gt; were used for making <br>references to the part of the text/to the bibliography. Usage of attributes can be also noticed: role, id, url, language etc.

<h3>Project 3</h3>

The subject of the third project is to make a simple presentation in the XML language. The elements from the XML document need to be described in some of the following languages: DTD, XML Schema or RELAX NG.  XSLT documents need to be also created. Actually, three XSLT documents are required: one that will enable transformation from XML to XHTML+CSS, other will enable transformation from XML to PDF file and the third one will be common from both XSLT. 
My presentation which was made in XML language, was about creating an information system for travel agency. In the presentation were included use case diagrams, a description about the product – information system, and the goals that are planned to be reached. The elements form the XML document were descried by using the RELAX NG language. The main element is presentation, which consists of the following elements: the tittle of the presentation, its subtitle, author, date of creating and slides. The element slide has one attribute – number of the slide. The basic elements of the element slide are title of the slide and text that actually defines the content of each slide. Other elements included in the XML document are: itemlist, item, subtext, image etc. XSLT documents that enable transformation from XML to XHTML+CSS and from XML to PDF format were using common variables defined in other XSLT. In fact, that variables were defined because they were common for both XHTML and PDF presentation: color, background, size of the title/subtitle/text, font style, height and width of an image etc. Thanks of these XSLT documents PDF and XHTML presentation from and XML document, were successfully created.
